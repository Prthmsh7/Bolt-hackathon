# 🎟️ Token‑Funded Projects Platform (TFP)

**Token‑Funded Projects Platform** is a fractional‑ownership marketplace that empowers developers to mint digital tokens representing shares in their projects—like AI agents, e-commerce tools, or SaaS—and offers investors micro‑shares with ongoing royalty income and liquidity.

---

## 🚀 Why It Matters

- For **Developers**: Access funding early by selling fractional project ownership (e.g., 1,000 tokens = 100 % of future earnings). Retain control while scaling your idea.
- For **Investors**: Invest as little as ₹10–₹20 in innovative projects and earn proportional revenue when the project makes money.
